                                Which, of course, brings me to this Coding Bootcamp Course at UT Austin. The coursework is kind of melting my 
                                brain a little bit, but I'm not QUITE drowning as badly as I expected to be. Hopefully, with enough time, dedication
                                and more than a little elbow grease, I can turn these skills into a workable career shift.

							<p>
                                Weird Al is a musician and comedic performer. Alfred Matthew Yankovic was born October 23, 1959, in Lynwood, California. An only child, he began playing the accordion at age seven, following in the tradition of polka star Frank Yankovic (no relation). In his early teens he became an avid fan of the Dr. Demento show, drawing inspiration from the parodies of Allan Sherman as well as the musical comedy of Spike Jones, Tom Lehrer, and Stan Freberg. In 1973, Demento spoke at Yankovic's school, where the 13-year-old passed the radio host a demo tape of home recordings; three years later, Demento played Yankovic's "Belvedere Cruising" -- an accordion-driven pop song written about the family's Plymouth -- on the air, and his career was launched.

                                Since his first-aired comedy song in 1976, he has sold more than 12 million albums (as of 2007),[3] recorded more than 150 parody and original songs,[4][5][6] and performed more than 1,000 live shows.[7] His works have earned him five Grammy Awards and a further eleven nominations, four gold records, and six platinum records in the United States. Yankovic's first top ten Billboard album (Straight Outta Lynwood) and single ("White & Nerdy") were both released in 2006, nearly three decades into his career. His latest album, Mandatory Fun (2014), became his first number-one album during its debut week.

                                        clicking on the video simply brings up a 
                                        "This video is unavailable" error. As 
                                        best as I can figure out, this is due to 
                                        the fact that the "website" is a html file 
                                        on my local hard drive, instead of being 
                                        legitimately online somewhere. Ideally I 
                                        would just host it somewhere cheaply, but 
                                        I don't know if we're expected to go that 
                                        far for a simple Pre-Course-Work assignment.-->

                                    Weird Al is also known for working outside of direct music productions themselves, appearing on novelty YouTube series such as "Hot Ones", where celebrities eat increasingly spicy chicken wings while conducting an interview:

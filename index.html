                    Born in Hawaii and raised in California's Bay Area, I've been intimately familiar with tech and technology
                    from a young age. Growing up in Silicon Valley 
                    I attended Westmont College in Santa Barbara, CA and graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in English, mostly out 
                    of a process of elimination after discovering that I wasn't terribly good in most other subjects in school. 
                    The increased fluency that comes along with writing talent has been a direct boost to my communicative skills 
                    in the professional world, as well. I took a single Computer Science course in college, learning C++, and I 
                    barely managed to scrape by with a D+. For years, the high difficulty of the course convinced me that I was no good 
                    at programming/coding.

                    After graduation, I moved to Texas to continue what had previously been a summer job: Video Game Quality Assurance. 
                    My professional resume has included credits on everything from semi-obscure Japanese RPGs <i>(Eternal Sonata[PS3])</i> 
                    to big-budget Triple-A titles <i>(Halo 4, Sid Meier's Civilization V) </i> to MMOs <i>(City of Heroes, Lineage II, 
                    DC Universe Online)</i> and much more.

                The seedy underbelly of the QA industry, however, is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9ZdU1RQjmc">very</a>
                <a href="https://kotaku.com/quality-assured-what-it-s-really-like-to-play-games-fo-1720053842">well documented</a> , 
                and it's one that I've run face-first into. Despite enjoying my work, a low pay rate, lack of benefits and extreme 
                job instability have led me to seek a career shift. I figure that my analytical skills from QA, not to mention my
                collaborative works (I worked extensively with other development departments in my last position, liasing between 
                Art, Design and Systems Programmers) make for a good starting base for learning how to code.

                    Which, of course, brings me to this Coding Bootcamp Course at UT Austin. The coursework is kind of melting my 
                    brain a little bit, but I'm not QUITE drowning as badly as I expected to be. Hopefully, with enough time, dedication
                    and more than a little elbow grease, I can turn these skills into a workable career shift.
